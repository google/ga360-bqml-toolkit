# BQML Toolkit

The goal of this toolkit is to jumpstart the process of creating propensity
models in BQML. The toolkit provides templated SQL queries to generate feature
sets and models.

While there are pre-built models natively available in GA360, creating a custom
model allows more freedom for customization, or predicting specific events or
behaviors that are not captured by native ML models. This provides a starter
template for building your own predictive model utilizing the BQ Export.

This is not meant to be an exhaustive solution or cover every use case. No two
models are the same, so you should tweak with your own timelines and business
case in mind.

For more on BQML, see the
[documentation](https://cloud.google.com/bigquery-ml/docs).

## Components

### Queries

The `sql` folder contains sample scripts, some of which are utilized in `create_and_run_queries.py`.
Most importantly, `create_daily_feature_set.sql` creates generalizable features at the user-level,
which are then used for predicting future behavior. 

### Python script

The Python script included will automate the process of reading in the base
feature set and model training SQL files, passing in the necessary parameters,
running the queries in BigQuery, and saving the results.

## Installation

### Pull in GA360 data

This repo solely utilizes data generated by the GA360 BigQuery Export.
If you are GA360 customer but do not have the export implemented, see [this page](https://support.google.com/analytics/answer/3416092)
for instructions on setting it up.
Alternatively, you can use publicly available data by following the directions [here](https://support.google.com/analytics/answer/7586738).

#### Modify the queries (optional)

Because this code was made to work with any GA360 implementation, there is no
site-specific behavior captured; similarly, this relies on eCommerce transactions
as the behavior of interest, which may not be the ideal use case for all marketers.

Here are some suggested additions that can be made to the feature set:
- Custom dimensions and metrics
- Hit-level data (what pages were visited?)
- Events, if captured correctly

BQML also allows for an increasing number of ML models by simply using SQL-like syntax.
It is suggested that for models used in production, the user adjust BQML parameters,
and/or test different BQML models to optimize performance.

### Running the Python script
If you want to run on Cloud Shell, click the button below to deploy. You will
need to run `gcloud init login` to make sure your credentials are up to date. 
[![Run on Google Cloud](https://deploy.cloud.run/button.svg)](https://deploy.cloud.run)

If you want to run in your own environment, you will need to set up
authentication. Follow [the steps outlined
here](https://cloud.google.com/docs/authentication/production#create_service_account) to create a service account and
save it in your environment. Then you will need to add these credentials as an
environment variable.

To run, you need a few pieces of information: 
* `project_id`: the ID of your GCP project 
* `ga_dataset`: the BigQuery dataset where you have stored your GA export data


Then, run this command in Cloud Shell: `python3 create_and_run_queries.py [project_id]
[ga_dataset]`. Note that this will default to saving the feature set and model in
the same dataset as your GA360 BQ Export.

### What next?
After training a model, a common next step is pushing user scores back into GA360, where you can create custom audiences to target. For easy implementation, check out
[Project Modem](https://github.com/google/modem) to create an
automated pipeline for activating the data from your model.
